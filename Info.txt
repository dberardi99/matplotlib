1. Problems while installing matplotlib in developer mode...

Both ninja library and C++ interpreter are needed. For the latter (on Windows) installs Visual Studio 2022 with C++ extensions.

2. Why VS Code doesn't found modules in virtual environment?

By running the files through "Run Code" button we'll get an error, instead by using "Run Python File" it works (LOL :/).
It seems like VS Code doesn't recognise that we are pointing the matplotlib version that we are modifying.
The same script typed in the venv's Python interpreter works with no problems.
