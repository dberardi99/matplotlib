1. Problems while installing matplotlib in developer mode...

Both ninja library and C++ interpreter are needed. For the latter (on Windows) installs Visual Studio 2022 with C++ extensions.

2. Why VS Code doesn't found modules in virtual environment?

By running the files through "Run Code" button we'll get an error, instead by using "Run Python File" it works (LOL :/).
It seems like VS Code doesn't recognise that we are pointing the matplotlib version that we are modifying.
The same script typed in the venv's Python interpreter works with no problems.

3. Why VS Code doesn't allow to debug file normally?

In the launch.json file set the property "justMyCode" to false. Following an example of the cited file:

{

    // Hover to view descriptions of existing attributes.

    "version": "0.2.0",
    "configurations": [
        {
            "name": "Current File",
            "type": "debugpy",
            "request": "launch",
            "program": "${file}",
            "console": "integratedTerminal",
            "justMyCode": false // For more info, visit: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/54009081/how-can-i-debug-a-python-code-in-a-virtual-environment-using-vscode
